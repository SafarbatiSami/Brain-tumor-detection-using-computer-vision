# Brain-tumor-detection-using-computer-vision
Computer vision can detect the presence or absence of tumor in the brain. In this project i'm using image processing techniques to detects neoplasm (abnormal mass of tissue through which cells grow and multiply uncontrollably).
**First step is image pre-processing** which consist of reducing/removing noise in the image, in our case its an MRI.
we use a Median Filter for noise reducing.
**Second step is image Croping** which consist of resizing the image to a standard format.<br>
**Binarize image**:<br>
**Finding contours**:<br>
**Drawing contours**:<br>


Language : Python <br>
libraries : OpenCV2 ,Numpy.<br>
